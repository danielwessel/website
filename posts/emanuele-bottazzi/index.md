###### Real projections of non-standard functions


In non-standard analysis, there are many ways to coherently project a non-standard function to a standard real function. The most famous among those projections is the standard part. This procedure maps non-standard functions satisfying a regularity hypothesis called S-continuity to real continuous functions. If time allows, we will also show how a less regular non-standard function can be projected to a real distribution.
