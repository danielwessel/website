_The Hahn-Banach theorem, constructively revisited_

We review known constructive versions, such as the separation theorem and continuous extension theorem, of the Hahn-Banach theorem and their proofs, and consider new versions including the dominated extension theorem and their proofs.

_Finite sets and infinite sets in weak intuitionistic arithmetic_

We consider, for a set A of natural numbers, the following notions of finiteness

FIN1: There are k and m0,...,mk-1 such that A={m0,...,mk-1} ;\
FIN2: There is an upper bound for A;\
FIN3: There is m such that for all B ⊆ A (|B|<m);\
FIN4: It is not the case that, for all x, there is y such that y∈ A;\
FIN5: It is not the case that, for all m, there is B ⊆ A such that |B|=m,

and infiniteness

INF1: There are no k and m0,...,mk-1 such that A={m0,...,mk-1};\
INF2: There is no upper bound for A;\
INF3: There is no m such that for all B ⊆ A (|B|<m);\
INF4: For all y, there is x>y such that x∈ A;\
INF5: For all m, there is B ⊆ A such that |B|=m.

We systematically compare them in the method of constructive reverse mathematics. We show that the equivalence among them can be characterized by various combinations of induction axioms and non-constructive principles, including the axiom called bounded comprehension.

_Choice principles and the tripos-to-topos construction_

In this talk we study the connections between choice principles expressed in categorical logic and the Tripos-to-Topos construction [HJP80].
This is a joint work with M. E. Maietti and G. Rosolini based on [MPR, MR16, Pas17].

_Unifying (Herbrand) functional interpretations of (nonstandard) arithmetic_

We extend Oliva’s method [3] to obtain a parametrised functional interpretation for nonstandard arithmetic. By instantiating the parametrised relations, we obtain the Herbrand functional interpretations introduced in [2,4] for nonstandard arithmetic as well as the usual, well-known ones for Berger’s uniform Heyting arithmetic [1].

Please note further that on Thursday, October 5th, 4pm,
there will be a [departmental seminar](https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=seminario&id=4085) with [Olivia Caramello](https://www.oliviacaramello.com/):
_The proof-theoretic relevance of Grothendieck topologies_
