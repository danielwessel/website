_Empirical Negation and Beth Semantics_

The negation in intuitionistic logic has a ‘future-oriented’ character, as
elucidated by the valuation in Kripke models. Its application in mathematical
contexts has been validated by the success of constructive mathematics. Its
applicability in non-mathematical contexts, in contrast, is argued to have some
problems. The existence of a different, ‘empirical’ notion of negation within
the framework of intuitionistic logic has been discussed by Heyting, Dummett
and others. De (2013) proposed empirical negation as falsity at the bottom root
of a Kripke model, and De and Omori (2014) gave the axiomatisation of this
logic.

In this talk, I will discuss how the choice of semantics in formulating
empirical negation affects the logic one obtains, with Beth semantics as a
particular example. This is followed by an examination of arithmetic with
empirical negation.
