_Graph Theory and the Transfinite_

A bit more than a 100 years ago, as a response to the foundational crisis in
mathematics, Hermann Weyl published his "Das Kontinuum" in which he tried to
rebuild mathematics from a stance that assumes the existence of the set of
natural numbers as an actual completed infinity but no higher infinities. Much
later in the 1970s, logicians began to systematically scour various chunks of
ordinary mathematics to determine the existential commitments to the infinite
that they required. This is known as "Reverse Mathematics". To put it roughly,
it turned out that most of "ordinary" mathematics didn't need more than what
Weyl had assumed. However, there are some notable exceptions. In particular
graph theory sports some very nice theorems that require more of the
transfinite. The talk will discuss some famous theorems and their relationships
with the infinite world.
