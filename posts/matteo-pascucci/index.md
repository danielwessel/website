###### A unified treatment of propositional constants in modal logic


The history of propositional constants in modal logic dates back at least to
the Fifties. Such constants have been used for several purposes, including:
the definition of deontic modalities in terms of alethic ones, the
definition of notions of actuality such as "the current world" or "the
present instant", the representation of the states of a relational frame
within a modal language, the development of normal systems of contingency
logic in which necessity is definable and some results of Post-completeness.
My work consists in providing a unified semantic framework for modal
languages enriched with constants. The basic idea is to use a special sort
of general frames where any propositional constant has its own set of
possible interpretations. Within this approach I will discuss some
model-theoretic issues and analyze some differences between languages with
constants and standard languages of modal logic.
