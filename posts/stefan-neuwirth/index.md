###### Paul Lorenzen: logicÂ and algebra




Lorenzen discovered before 1944 that endowing a preordered set with a system of ideals has the same formal structure as proving the non-contradiction of a logical calculus. This discovery had as effect a new definition of a system of ideals as a logical calculus: a so-called single-conclusion entailment relation, ideated by Paul Hertz in 1923.




We shall tell this episode of the years 1939-1951 and show how this approach enables the development of divisibility theory of an integral domain without set theory.
